# Problematic Internet Use (PIU) Research Project

## Overview
This project analyzes the impact of **Problematic Internet Use (PIU)** on **physical fitness metrics in youth**. The study involves collecting data on internet usage patterns and correlating them with physical fitness indicators to identify potential risks and behavioral trends. Machine Learning (ML) techniques are used to derive insights and predictive models from the dataset.

## Objectives
- Analyze the correlation between **internet usage habits** and **physical fitness metrics**.
- Identify behavioral patterns associated with **Problematic Internet Use (PIU)**.
- Develop **predictive models** using Machine Learning to assess risks associated with excessive internet usage.
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve youth fitness and well-being.

## Features
- **Data Collection & Processing**: Aggregates user-reported internet usage and physical activity data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifies trends and correlations between PIU and fitness metrics.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predicts physical fitness outcomes based on internet usage patterns.
- **Visualization**: Generates interactive graphs and reports for better insight presentation.
- **Recommendations & Insights**: Provides actionable insights for policymakers, educators, and parents.


## Data Collection
The dataset includes:
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, location
- **Internet Usage**: Daily screen time, most used platforms, peak usage hours
- **Physical Fitness Metrics**: BMI, heart rate, step count, sleep duration
- **Self-Reported Survey Data**: Psychological well-being, mood, and productivity levels
